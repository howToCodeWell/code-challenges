# Python challenges
These three Python challenges focus on tuples, sets dictionaries and strings.
Create a GitHub Repo with a Python file per level. Submit your GitHub Repository to the Discord channel.
I will review these live on Twitch at the end of August.

## Level 1 - Find the duplicates in a Python Tuple
How many times is `1` duplicated in this Tuple `1,1,2,3,4,1,5,6,7,1`
 
## Level 2 - Find the max and min in a Python Set
Print the max and min numbers in this set `set([15, 11, 8, 15, 32, 20])`

## Level 3 - Count characters in a string
Create function that counts the characters in the string; `Row Row Row Your Boat`
The function should return a dictionary where the index is the character and it's value is counter. 
EG `{'R': 3, 'B':1}`
