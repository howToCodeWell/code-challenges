# Python challenges
These three Python challenges focus on Tuples, Sets Dictionaries and Strings.
Create a GitHub repository with a Python file per level. 

Submit your GitHub Repository to the [Coding-Challenges channel](https://discord.gg/McBDkkb) in the [How To Code Well Discord server](https://howtocodewell.net/discord).

I will review these [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/howtocodewell) at the end of August.

## Level 1 - Find the duplicates in a Python Tuple
How many times is `1` duplicated in the following Tuple 

`1,1,2,3,4,1,5,6,7,1`

For example `1` is in the Tuple 4 times
 
## Level 2 - Find the max and min of a Python Set
Print the max and min numbers of this set 

`set([15, 11, 8, 15, 32, 20])`

For example 8 and 32

## Level 3 - Count characters in a string
Create function that counts the characters in the string; 

`Row Row Row Your Boat`

The function should return a dictionary where the index is the character and it's value is character count. 

For example `{'R': 3, 'B':1}`

R is found in the string 3 times, B is found in the string 1 time and so on
