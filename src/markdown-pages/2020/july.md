# Regex Tests
Let's work on some regex. Using this set of numbers `123-939-7878` complete the following levels.

- You can use PHP, Python or JavaScript for this challenge.
- Create one answer per level. 

## Level 1 - The simplest way
Yes, this is a trick question. What is the simplest way to check for EXACTLY this set of numbers?
Remember the simplest way is not always the correct way ;)
 
## Level 2 - Character classes
Use character classes to check for the numbers. You can also use sets if you want

## Level 3 - Short hand only
Now simplify the answer using short hand syntax. You can also use sets if you want

## Level 4 - Group those numbers
Let's turn those numbers into groups.

## Level 5 - You see hyphens I see brackets
What happens if the hyphens are sometimes open and closed brackets like this:

`(123)(939)(7878)`

Or like this

`(123)-939-(7878)`

Adjust your answer to cope with hyphens and/or brackets.
